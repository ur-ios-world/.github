# Welcome to Ur iOS World!

We are a collaborative community sharing the responsibility of
maintaining iOS-based projects. Inspired by [Jazzband](https://github.com/jazzband),
it gives maintainers and contributors the ability to "play in the same band"
instead of being forced into "artist" and "audience" roles.

Essentially, the community deminishes the maintenance burden and increases the
lifespan of packages by having everyone work together.
